# Project Title

Simple Router with Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

## Description

This project is a simple router built with Node.js, using Prisma to interact with a PostgreSQL database. The router allows you to create, read, update, and delete books through various API endpoints. It's a minimalistic implementation to handle HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate controllers to manage the book data.

## Requirements

- Node.js [Version]
- PostgreSQL [Version]
- Prisma [Version]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up the database:

- Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
- Run Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
npx prisma migrate
```

## Configuration

- If required, update the Prisma database connection configuration in the `prisma/client` section of `models/bookModel.js` file to match your PostgreSQL database settings.
